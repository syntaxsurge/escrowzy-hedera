## 🚀 Executive Summary

**Escrowzy** is the world's first gamified DeFi platform that transforms
traditional P2P trading and token swapping into an engaging, trust-minimized
experience. We've created a revolutionary **Battle-to-Trade** mechanism where
traders compete for 25% fee discounts, earning Combat Power through achievement
NFTs. Built on Hedera's EVM-compatible blockchain, we're redefining how users
interact with DeFi through gamification.

### 🎯 The Innovation That Changes Everything

**Problem**: DeFi platforms suffer from poor user engagement, high friction, and
trust issues in P2P trading.

**Our Solution**: We've gamified the entire trading experience:

- **Battle Arena**: Win PvP battles → Get 25% trading fee discount for 24 hours
- **Achievement NFTs**: Trade more → Earn NFTs → Increase Combat Power → Win
  more battles
- **Trust-Minimized P2P**: Smart contract escrow with multi-sig for high-value
  trades
- **Frictionless Onboarding**: Email login via Thirdweb - no seed phrases, no
  friction
